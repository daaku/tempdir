Installation
------------
  # gem install tempdir


Usage
-----

WARNING: The temp directory will be automatically 'rm -rf'ed. So dont store
non-temporary things in there. If a block is given, this will happen as soon as
the block has finished executing. Otherwise then the finalizer is called on the
returned object.

Examples:
require 'tempdir'
dir = Tempdir.new('my-basename')
puts dir.path

Tempdir.new('my-basename') { |d| puts d.path }
